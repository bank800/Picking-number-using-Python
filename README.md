Sure, let's go through the program line by line:

```python
from tkinter import *
from random import choice
```
- This imports the `Tk` class and other necessary functions and classes from the `tkinter` module for building graphical user interfaces. It also imports the `choice` function from the `random` module, which will be used to select a random element from a list.

```python
App = Tk()
```
- This creates an instance of the `Tk` class, representing the main window of the application.

```python
App.title('Element Picker')
```
- This sets the title of the main window to 'Element Picker'.

```python
App.geometry('350x100')
```
- This sets the initial size of the main window to 350 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall.

```python
inp = Entry(App)
inp.pack()
```
- This creates an Entry widget (a text input field) and places it inside the main window (`App`) using the `pack` geometry manager. This widget allows users to input a list of elements separated by commas.

```python
def pick():
    INP = (inp.get()).split(',')
    msg = Label(App, text=choice(INP))
    msg.pack()
```
- This defines a function `pick()` that will be called when the user clicks the 'choose' button. 
- It first gets the text entered into the Entry widget (`inp.get()`), splits it into a list of elements based on commas using the `split()` method, and stores it in the variable `INP`.
- It then creates a Label widget (`msg`) containing a randomly chosen element from the list `INP` using the `choice()` function from the `random` module.
- Finally, it places the Label widget inside the main window (`App`) using the `pack` geometry manager.

```python
B = Button(App, text='choose', command=pick)
B.pack()
```
- This creates a Button widget (`B`) with the text 'choose' and associates it with the `pick()` function to be called when clicked (`command=pick`).
- It then places the Button widget inside the main window (`App`) using the `pack` geometry manager.

```python
App.mainloop()
```
- This starts the Tkinter event loop, which listens for events (such as button clicks or window resizing) and handles them accordingly. The program will continue to run until the main window is closed by the user.
